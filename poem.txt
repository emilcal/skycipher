HYPERSLEEP/THE TERRORISTS POTLATCH
Anybody who has traveled this far on a fools errand said Salo has no choice but to uphold the honour of fools by completing the errand

 tranquillising within it sweet words like coins back in day on sailors eyes drifting alone into vast cold places Hell cannot attack unbelievers the delights of damnation will deepen I don't mean to brag my own name is meaningless the way I spit it from my mouth it will soon be gone but spare a second the spice is so finite and the dream of death so vast what creature could command her heart Satori I Arborist of rivers coagulating with silt the choking armatures I've dismembered redirecting to myself all minerality of waters all knowledge coursing like something vampiric of memories I drink as like some mad heroin sick junky sucking throats rivers the waters of the soul or limits and the next between this world who dreamt of them eyes rewinding into the blood ether of veins rootlike beneath the surface riverine the surface Satori II Has the past never opened up to you as night may suddenly as may backward looking stars mirrored in distances pooling in your mind as like drops of quicksilver condensation of mercury risen to your head nests of Victorian train station security camera cockatoo on telegraph wire is car park blanketed in vines the shop where they once sold newspapers and you watched Brum silently as trains and citizens fl it unfocused by I'm stupefied for years by this oblivion between which the desk and I the wall I slipped down now noiselesness is already forever now I try to live a normal life and I can tell you it's surprising truly compared to all these addicts am like day labourers in the pits of hell pitbosses yelling at them to get high all the fuckin time and experience the disrobing of reality all the time like some sort of fucked up peep show with no choice no consent all the time without respite I'm done with that cartography oceanography of dream states soundings no one can grasp surrounding bright lights in the eyes glowing like worms eating my incandescent brain I pull the skirts of reality back up over her Like Orpheus on the way back up I'm on the up It's hard problems of utility only water with eyes closed welling over with oracles all night long a reign of green that knows no decline like flash of wings unfolding sky in which the world is visible in your body transparent in your transparency rain quiet rain thin with oracles in which a night spent reign within closed wells eyes brimming with light hollows I thought I thought I could just wander into some blue collar state of grace But instead just upped my dosage of despair my chin is too high Let it be known that I have consumed a considerable amount of marijuana and that the plane taking off is really syncing up with my music nicely wish it would last longer I’m becoming a bore as it approaches normalcy my life feels made up as it recedes away from dereliction false notes from forgetting impotent from sorrow lost Lost Lost I love to hear the word And want to put it into as many possible combinations I can think of Hearing it I feel at home From sorrow lost to think of the future no more than it me The mind is this tipper cabin this moulded plastic clipped to its metal frame in the factories of Seoul without thought or feeling both appear and disappear this decal peeling from its worn layer of paint this impact hammer slamming into the rock peels chunks off with ease that hit the damp black salty earth no with real feel of mass why do I cry silently at the thought of inevitable labour like a beetle pinched between a jamb as the door swings open slowly from the portal dirt spattering onto the cold tiles and turning brittle as the water secretly escapes into the air this windshield this light tunnel car pelting space through like a pebble from sling to this hole toward in ground is the sky into I fall falling upwards like an astronaut caught in the knowledge that today is yesterday the water keeps scrawling it's notes down through thick gullet of earth its questions plumb and just like each of your own mesmerising songs you let trail off as the cicadas began to take flight escaping dead cells at at at last their own chorus still ringing in the throat of the day just gone shells as deaf as satellites pray inward to the sap it is greater to return from the night of memory ablaze as one from ashes as men from the belly of the earth Tomorrow can only be achieved through making the impossible possible like dead pharaohs await judgement it once again appears I am nothing unblinking silence black pith into which nothing more can go or reunite it's paths toward buried cash glock birds flight or tongues alive with guesses sparks diamonds to the she sheds like suns the heat of gods molten or partially as submerged motorbikes sleep on as you may never wake from the earth it is purple where its hypnotic flowers of iron open up blood hot in the grip of time blood hot in the grip of disembowelling machinery the size of apartments wheels the size of warehouse shovels the size of supermarket computerised in the quiet cabin from where its huge armature sweeps megalithically across barren piles of earth and the operator barely moves but only occasionally flicks his wrist and intercom sputters momentarily growling undertow of rock that rivers feed off pulling out its silt like iron in the lung sucking at the sky fathering the sun who taught us I dwell in a membrane of refuse walls peeling and slipped with graffiti in alien clicks and gold leaf it is all the sky once as but a memory I was lost in a labyrinth of subway tunnels which train carcasses rot down I will steal this fire for you I will impugn all other attempts I will disgorge gods love for the single moment in which I will for ever in the sliding night a jewel of cities across a car as it coasts your head falls backwards and catches the welcoming blackness of the sky the old ones unblinkingly sat in train of satellites gliding motion and the hills over the ocean rock back drunk on words that have no meaning which carry themselves onwards like the satellites winking above us in insect unison and suddenly you feel held and can breathe at last transfixed by visions transfixed by certitude transfixed with cup the unreachable filleth the way up and down the same a bat blinks folding slender black limbs wrapped in dusk as you are For this poem can never end it must find its way back to itself eventually like waters returning forever via skies the oracle and sign of its own emergence and disappearance As it becomes increasingly impersonal it becomes more inalienable and as it draws near ineffable As it cycles so more sonorous and in each rewinding finds its source
 in litany of chaotic words I can no no longer distinguish between the poem and the voice the world unfolds to me identically The last mammalian voice The metaphor of industry applied to nature as if some army wired up the forest sunk the trunks of trees like railway tracks the forest or nature or whatever its image may so perfectly be a path knowingly laid that it might lead us somewhere that it is in fact a wreck of all the life that went before rusting and rotting and altering openended titanic bones and sockets a dark whisper what difference does it make even a thousand years could not extinguish the festering trillion life and before the sun goes cold new blood will rise from the sump ____ Angel of Rome Clouds rising blossom size of continents Thoughts arrow lengthens as its distance travels silences extending dream of the sky to inhabit navigated by its currents we unhurried and in spite of which I saw pigeons feet between the window and the plumbing the little movements of his body and when i was alone from you a little angel came and sat next to me speaking in Italian with scars Criss crossing her tiny arms and departing she wiped the tears from my eyes hallucinated by trees you find yourself in a state of how shall we say solemnity of refuse the sky in moments the falsetto morning deep in thought as like arched concrete cathedral sewer moss covered wall trailers hauled up on the road among no fewer the roots running enveloped among ruckus rooting stiffening among cleverer delights the water somnambulist to throes you are invincible in to each day to the minutiae of a million city inhabitants going about essential work the wheels the car turn for ever the leaves curl the water it expires from fleet the vehicles unison In deep tunnels on overpasses Through piling nights Enjeweled by the jeweler of lights of enshrining knowledge of youths fig of ecstasy the powders splice 
through of poisons we wish the song would go on but yet it stops and the curtain of earths broad horizon scanned I flicked life away When I heard this tremendous I flicked it off Like a cockroach Since our soul has always been composed of artificial layers Its scale its miniature quality although artiicial only in the sense that it belies its own grandeur that it couldn't or wouldn't exist today without human help it whispers to us of our powers and our distance from things How then are we small compared to that tiny bit of nature still left unspoiled Tiny compared to the ducks pigeons waterfowl and ibis that thrive among this man made lake And the refuse of underpasses the mass of smooth slabs cold and monolithic tectonic they shoulder the traffic of the city Amid the debris and refuse of modern living the bright plastic discarded construction materials shopping trolleys sinews of fibre optics reach like vines into telecom towers And this little garden whose only purpose is to please the residents of the neighbouring suburbs I went to the toilet a thought occurred I need this apathy it cannot for me have the negativity surrounding it that it does for others Because for me it is a necessity a hygiene it cleanses me of this excess which always pulls me in too many directions if I didn't periodically close my heart to everything I would be lost to the magnitudes right in front of me It's not until I stop and say enough I want nothing That I realise I already have everything Like When metaphors struck you first starkly with the power of their image which happened a lot when you were a child “The light at the end of the tunnel” from that you perceived a feeling of being presently stuck claustrophobically in a tunnel_ UtilityJust as when a carcass is utilised completely and not one part wasted so too poetry makes use of a life LAND OF EARTH AND SKY All the leaves under the sun are silver reflections of the disc in brotherhood with the sky my eye a lake the sun turns himself into and into each he turns as night into day and mind the nocturnal erasure of the ocean as it reflects the moon clinamen It doesn't matter what you try to do with the life that is given you really because at the end of the day your main emotion your main attitude will determine its course surveillance warnings surveillance cameras ibis commuters car parks street lights underpasses transport worker on his phone Indian guy blossom and the blossoms bond the issue of a single momentous gunshot echoing into eternity rupturing eternity and giving birth to eternity and the side of the moon we never see the bicycle bells ringing together like some innocent choir as they sail on the ether toward some infinitismal loophole no one's ever heard of or seen soft rain of petals turning like suicidal lovers through the air in a cascade of silence going nowhere looks of peace in their softly closed lids each longed for by bees who remain and search for them becoming enthralled by time to search on for their lovers in another form and finding only their shadows in the pollens drifting lazily on dappled after noons of a two week lifespan Tell mum you miss her The eternal revolution gods people will be free Just came to the solemn realisation that I love getting high fucked up wasted shitfaced stoned off my face trolleyed love getting plastered tripping balls feeling no pain flying getting sauced fried can't get enough of being absolutely zoned out reading from the script taking notation listening to the receiver addicted to somnambulism ventriloquism speaking in tongues eyes rolled up hearing the voice of god seeing and being burnt up by the vision If there was a button and pressing it could free you from everything that presses down on you how would you know you weren't His arms looked like old broccoli His eyes went opaque like shrimp shells SOMEWHERE IN THE FACTORIES OF REALITY Bicycle body hoisted up and crucified on the old iron fretwork fence which no one seems to notice dying like an ancient god with spears thru his chest I can see the solemn mischief in the eyes of the executioner drunk in the depth of night Go to an old cemetery and read the stones like some riddle answerer from Resident Evil There is nothing more mournfully beautiful than the waking city in the early morning The colours of the night sky soften backlit they outline rows of car parks streetlights overpasses factories It's not bright enough to turn the lights off but the eastern sky is opening like a flower just as we open to waking life like saplings In the morning the people are at their most habitual those early risers going about without a word and when a word is necessary it’s given over like precious silver go on but yet it stops and the curtain of earths broad horizon scanned I flicked life away When I heard this tremendous I flicked it off Like a cockroach _______ And it's days just like this in which everything that you ever wanted disappears like vapour into the clouds Joining foreign tribes that roll across the stratosphere bursting over whole nations silent and heavy as the night they act in common wordlessly ______ NO SAFE PLACE Two head states everything is wonderful life is full of poflibilities each thing has its turn on the wheel so there is no hard feelings let nature wax and wane as it will your activities were always held in miniature from the beginning like petals waiting to unfurl Let it go however it goes 2 No safe place mute carousel we ride on endless nature has come to an end humankind without her an echo no other ness just an argument with itself that cannot close no outside and no point The world for workers is truly inhospitable Where has the silence gone The machine silence the traffic inertia the screen lethargy these flowers find me ecstasy in dissociation as opposed to the noisy talkative world We are required to fulfil quotas of keywords daily Insufferable cheerfulness dampens everything Billboards phones colleagues continuous and difficult to ignore Did the silence I dream of ever exist? Does it only exist now by simulation when I plug my ears with devices Like electrical parasites with feelers connected to my nervous system deep in my ear drum When I speak there is silence too Each time my mouth opens a void created Depositing like dark seed far and wide For all its noise is life today not silent after all? As if the carousel of objects and news and images were just another way to nothing As I write this the work van filters through heavy traffic in the rain my colleagues chat noisily but I can't hear them I know it's stupid to wish for an end to work But as we enter a tunnel beneath the canopy of twinkling lights we rush under I can't help it _______ Each line both in breaking and uniting straight onward endlessly as light continuous as love as certain as destruction it binds me to this green reflected on slow waters by the skies infinity straight thru my eye like a piece of rebar the piercing world with notes still ringing from the bow as it was sent love is continuous grace of self forgetting thru which itself remembers like the world needs to recover itself in the memories I create goth is the night is a flower a flowers scent sends out it's need and the night in its jewel darkness sends out its velvet petals Each grey cloud is like an aspect of the flower each twinkling light a future ecstasy to a bee each light purposed by time and like the flowers imagined by a bee the sky has lights for me only I wrapped my whole life in them as if they could allow me to forget things things that don't go away I wrapped myself in their cloak and the cliff rolled back like eyes into the head folded neatly inward like silver dusted moth wings The glass of a parked semi trailer cab gives nothing away and simply reflects the night back upon itself In the aisle of the cliff my eyes too scanned canceled out across the ocean The space between the heavens and the earth slowly distilled like when capillary waves dissipate until it too was a mirror the sky mirrored the sea the sea the night the night the moons embedded orbit my soul scattered became 
in an instant it entered me I didn't recognise it at that moment which reached into like-spider catacomb fell spliced into my head aromas death intoxicated dreams like users in the slipstream dismembered of the world at last amputated i became 
phantom limb dream fabricated user the moth intoxicated sky became my soul its amputated orbit the cliff sidereal cliff of recognition fell head an instant of an echo of cloth dream fabricated of the spinning of it teleported to years in all directions a bend in the river flumes of light silent bystander transported to a seabed collected to blinking traffic lights on deserted corners water grasses rolling in rivers idly paddock of stars erupting simultaneously one head cannot contain bending years recognition woven of its spinning we encouraged of it we to ladders ascended or enclosed like angels bike in the sky like unison of satellite train etched by it like photolithography a lithography of the stars my brain became the meeting point of shadows orbit a calculus of dust transfigured engine the wheel always turning the potter always turning Drapery of leaves dangling spheres of water a slow stream of pedestrians and grannies taking out the rubbish just in time for the garbage man for whom a veritable Christmas of waste pours forth daily craning backward to glimmer a naked instant of passing huge booty the world silent to reheated cockles whose dormant memory passes across the gorgeous stream of light and flickers like a candle in a passing wind Not having a proper job neither money nor position and living by the light of love alone a phantom limb but one which is continually taking notes in a nonexistent notebook _______ Banana trees in the suburbs metal fences paint chalky weeds entering the carcasses of motorbikes indica in the white midday voices intercede with the silence from the highway on my behalf I have forgotten how to see the things that used to stand out to me through practice the stories fell as easily as child's toys when they step into adulthood and never look back into the lap of infinity which lay there before them and to which they were oblivious till then And I search around desperately The glovebox is empty Nothing under the seats Where has it gone It used to fall so easily into my lap It's because I got a job I paid my taxes I lost it while trying to hold on to it I am not a dreamer I am not I am a pure utilitarian This is cold logic Life disappears when you try to keep it Life is like an image in the desert horizon And the present seems more like a bad dream you might wake up from still a child still alive still filled with trees I feel guilty writing this to be honest I know you would feel so hurt to hear this These are the secrets we daren’t tell each other knowing that we are children at heart___ Order fell head on the way to a drug deal on the bus it fell on my head a thought like a dead angel looking up between the skyscrapers their shadows crisscrossing air dust hanging in yellow shafts as if caught in eternity this symmetry of order emerging just in time for me to peacefully meditate as though in vacuum of space released of gravity's spell I drift thoughtfully singly recalling my life like a drowned sailor forever enchanted mute blindly mesmer of a whale song distantly I wonder how the faraway lights orchestrated their disappearance how their orbits occluded or if the waves overhead might have carried me to other shores galaxies as immediate as cafes payphones traffic lights black lit toilet booths amid a litter of plastic baggies dull thud of basslines immaterial graze of anothers eyes intangible as the circles of orphan asteroids Nothing to say About this sun through these leaves and skies beyond I don't have to say anything about this it's already there simply an anonymous gift I am tossed continuously like they're falling off the back of a truck and I admire them and let them fall from my hand smooth pebbles into fast waters If I look closely I can see fish dart the blackness of the invisible currents the sun an infinite tear drop silvering it's surface its sorrow hot like when your cheeks burn through the cold hiding places thick with slowly rotting vegetation my hiding place a heart touching the hidden safety of yabbies eyes moving slowly as larger ones glide by zeppelin heavy and suspended rainbow scales catching aquatic lights thrown off in its multitudes and dimmed to the stillness How impossible that I am here at all in fervour secret the animal designed itself a scheme ecstatic a matrix of itself each neuron of its focused energies in order that it might finally sleep alive in its machinery including itself in the order of nature But it failed miserably since at that very moment nature disappeared and the animal was left entirely alone surrounded only by the products of its art Disney Inevitable and so labour drags me back to the world in which you can't help wanting to do things rather than not It gets its hooks in and the poison goes right between my eyes It is red and when I look into the underbelly of trees I feel my blood Like in accelerating engine pump rising and falling for a trillion years into an echo peeling out over landscapes cities the night purple and the ocean beneath the ocean I am what I am And whatever I'm doing at that I cruise down the street waiting in sky with rain suspended poised with lightning the waters torsion filling I forgot the cars v8s revving at the edge Tartarus I forgot the repo saw blowing through never ending limbs Inactivity can't do anything anymore the car population is hard it threatens us to ignore life is hard to ignore the similarity to things made up in my brain the same five bright things recur to ignore I could make a simple list and never have to write a drop of poetry again clear sky lucent rivers light catching leaves mesmerised bodies calculating the sun intuiting her glimpses reaching to her through the mouth of the river a silver pear glimpses of sound make waves around me as I step off a bus I will never break through the cloth of unreality even after having I wove around myself disowned all opiated words and disgorged them like someone greening out indica stained glass of cathedral branches powders in the nose hot molten liquors burning race course down gullet flame set eye provided knowledge brawling inmates at the hospice all things I thought I wanted _____ Ok I made it into this dust lifts nothing but rings no voice in the van only the rain I held a plastic flower or was it a name forgot its already forgotten the sky was happening without us somewhere a godmachine I thought the dream has ended but it just became the vehicle of light forgotten names arrive insects drawn to diesel a motorway angel wearing her scars in different languages I kissed the cathedral branches and they wilted labour means never ending what begins itself a streetlamp inside my chest I am an old instruction left in the machine vending to hungover gods she said “the earth is purple” and it was each morning is rebar pushed slowly through but the leaf still curls still the fish mirrors what sees the light still a river and I unfold or fall into again I was in a bad way at ruckus high as fuck and it was strangers Who helped us Red spilling from the petals breaching outward where the blade settled pink stench stinging the eyes when she said it plumed up in opiates insatiable as the stars she fed it skyward reaching pinnacle of the citadel is twinkling unteachable the minds bread on we fed in river bed wriggling like tadpoles life swelling outward from the energetic to the quickening trench so you bred it into it inklings radiant spiral from root to light is spinning yarn for cloth that it might cloak the bodies tranquillising within it The secrets of god words like gold coins in my eyes I let fall into the river clear and fast into the gutter I'm grateful there there are so many anew each day I do not need hold on to anything As soon as the sun went down hold on to anything anywhere as soon as the sun went down old man in the oval stretching skyward looking long deep then chasing committee of gulls gathered there a bad way at high as fuck strangers in the eyes of gold coins twisted as clear gutter waters my eyes unleashed as the drink poured forth the unteachable sun was drenched skyward reaching the unteachable high Skyward secrets twinkling No Thyself what use in verse the moment it falls from our lips it is ruined and ruins what it speaks of Doesn’t even fall anymore lays flat on screen with light going through from each generation since the loopdiloop began the same thing fell is it possible to create verse that is silent? Is chaos silent Is order Is there a string that is a star without having to mention them or a river without water a singular flow of invisible clarity a silent hall of golden light with only the sound sluicing rocks the space above it where day is filtered branching through limbs that drink at it becoming massive yet how long since I actually saw or swam down into it seeing the world from inside I asked the sky Despite its irrelevance I had to describe it It peered through the canopy everywhere I went It was inside me speaking itself Its words fell from my mouth like pebbles into lakes Beneath the glassy screen fish glide like thoughts without subjects And across it there was the sky again Soot choked pillars of brick and concrete layered massive with graffiti symmetry of rail and sleepers trays cable hand rails metal roofed beams of steel elongating impossible drops plumbing and wiring wound tightly and orderly around every surface and tunnelling down in beneath the buildings pile in close new on old and the shells of old buildings colonised with the new robotic and computerised shapes within at the construction site articulated dump trucks easing their trailers in backwards through scan of grey rain flanked by shining orange sentinels giving signal to the traffic that quickly builds up at the choke point the pivot on the back foot as the truck clears the roadway they spin the sign to go as they wave the traffic through the whipping water beating on the thick glass of the windshield the plastic creak as the steering wheel turns and swings the muted rumble of the tonne of car and rubber contact with the asphalt the driver leaning easily on one elbow while the other rests on the wheel there is a bright red glow refracted in the scintillate of waters across the car and across his face rear lights ____ Had a vision huge demoness But chrome And a with mascara the voice of the forgotten the homeless the unwanted the sound of firearms and sirens the Pell Nell of cars trains and buses the incredible silence of moving masses the distance of cold lights the intractable memory pimped out automobiles decaying roads and business detritus everywhere flood signs and plastic rubbish shopping trolleys abandoned to the wild now gone feral the incessant feralness looming behind everything waiting to consume it like weeds the wild the chaotic fecundity covering of all public infrastructure the monolithic concrete the fleets of workers crawling on everything the sinuous cables of data and electricity winding through everything like veins that snake the body the endless suburbia spreading in all directions the industrial estates outposted in the bush scaled with photovoltaic cells slender chimneys exude pale smoke into the sky could not the work performed on the earth I think about it a lot spires of glass and information air wake of jets across evening have you ever seen the earth parcelled up from above A national park a gene bank A highway circuit like iris filaments We have become custodian entire A spear of light hangs in my mind And my head droops slowly disgorging shining blood And my mouth continues to speak while its voice enters elsewhere And my activity happens by someone else which I watch indifferently even when it agonises slowly In the after noon crane logos Built OBAYASHI dexus Slowly and steadily the operator and his dogman lower a steel beam as long as a bus and as thick as a tree trunk The hook is painted in black and white diagonal stripes The tops of the buildings like nothing else They are the city If you saw the crowds filing through the tunnels under neath Cameras rake over them silently The whole thing emerging as from a dream When the sun sets the red seam of lights along the silhouette black struts of steel interlace way up into the sky over the heads of glass monoliths Angled arms of digging machinery idle in the hollowed earth There is no need for the king to abdicate he's already abdicated Just as everyone has Politics is left to the scavengers among us the bottom feeders the scum Since no reassuring ambience of other peoples lives going on adjacent to your own The dog is old and he's still on his legs So I carry him the whole way there When I get there there is a little Jewish boy with a red velvet hat the one that observant Jewish people wear having fun on his brand new roller blades There's a woman in a tweed jacket writing in a journal of some kind legs crossed on a park bench There's a beautiful Indian student dressed like a black panther smiling into her mobile phone Another small boy syncopates the atmosphere with the sound of kicks to his soccer ball Which he chases back and forth over the grass tirelessly The dog browses the smells avidly The sky is that particular celestial and transparent blue that only the sky can achieve Birds cut through the air between the trees The grass is thick as tousled hair Rolling in thick juicy strands across the slopes The dog and I stand in silence together watching the world around I used to think a log of this kind was a sign of egotism Now I see in it a sign of relinquishing As long as I observe objectively or as objectively as possible it is in fact an act of humility Here is the record of a life Written anonymously yet still an autobiography Really it should be published if at all under a nom de plum Narcosis As no Mountain After meeting with some drug addicts criminals of the worst order perhaps students or former students fallen into the most delirious decrepitude conceivable on account primarily of their absolutely pathetic wills covered in filth scabs draped in rags carrying a whiff of unwashed scrotum completely unlike the holy homeless you see around pursuing filth as a sacred mission unlike these because you can see the jealous rage burning their souls in thieving little eyes Realising with the usual brevity with what materials I'd been furnished Fox Motorcross hats cannibalised eastern Philosophy and French findesiecle aesthetic ideas What in gods name was I supposed to make with this porridge of nonsense But miraculously I'd been saved from my Protestant melancholy and returned to the animality from which I'd been running like an penitent idiot Entoproct I have no idea why it began Although it seems perfectly necessary it's given over like precious silver Feeling anything at all in response to anything whatsoever is itself something of a cliche And so is not feeling Everything is a cliche today At a certain distance all objects become mirror like She catch glimpses herself in the glass every chance she can get and who can blame her I catch glances her face a manny as possible and not just her face too A drunken guy pisses in a beer bottle and Leaves it in the gutter Along comes a homeless old guy and drinks it Thinking shit man free beer right on And upon realising it's true substance Curses his hapless fate Sleep is the cousin of death and I am the sleepwalker INTERIOR DECORATOR I am knee deep in domestic servitude URANIUM POEM When blasted with high powered laser simply produced more and myriad new substances CHROME goddess And haloed by screaming and skewered chrome babies A jawed vagina Fangs translucent Like an angler fish And a little light Dangling from a stamen like clit No doubt a poem For ancient drug hot pagans Red with the sting of winter and war ___I am a friend of the moon The sea that nations had forgot The shape of machines The passenger of dreams The encapsulating sky Everything's already happened At the bottom I found A socket It's mould filaments of gold It's dirt diamonds or a glock ____ Audition suggested by the sound of moths hitting the lampglass you find yourself perhaps in a state of shall we say deep in thought O death for thee have i borne the joys and pain of life are death of ecstasy and death of anguish deathless whispers and footfalls deathless opera beyond the still hall deathless song deathless mind sonorous alight the deathless gong the highway concrete in the mist of morning deathless mask the death defying ____ continually it ruptures flowers into currents death metal course electric fields striating waters talisman hot neon to the phantom eye summoned to its dream with the ringing of transparent gongs each note stepping off like passengers disembarking from a boat invisible feet alighting for a second before combusting like wisps of paper which curl up into shreds of ash goldleaf on the heels of their own inner light on heels which ignite like Mercury piston footwear hurtle him up to his aerial disembarkation between slipstreams vanishing on the heel of its own fatal image its own fractal shreds flashing like the corners of a mirror catching sky between surfaces the flower pursuant of water the flower the waters image of the sun they can not extinguish it left it's flaming wealth a miasma of light infecting my brain and turning it white as phosphorous as it turns inward and becomes an orphan satellite I grew up poor but I refuse to be ruled by money _____ before I was born I was nothing when I die nothing I'll be still All that I do will go will have gone and so will I If there's nowhere to rest at the end how can I get lost on the way Cant get lost going nowhere __ Nature is over or internalised only as longing now we have thinking machines so whats left for us strange I know I've already arrived because I'm nowhere ___ of god each coin for the dead to pass In the heart sweet words tranquillising within there was the silver still with which we lined pockets ghost water alone in dark we saw when death was the easiest and cheapest thing to get My own name was meaningless the way I spit it from my mouth it will soon be gone But spare a second The spice is so fi nite And the dream of death So vast there was the silver we lined our pockets with it I sing about nature because it is gone all possibilities cancelling one another And you the eye deleted dwindling like animals into numberless days just come back with a pocket full of cash or truths with real currency not some lone coin with your own face stamped on it like soul like memory own coins we dwindled ___ No point having any opinions perhaps you should try divesting yourself of such things like a cure for clutter to recklessly discarding the endless refuse of a life of having thoughts let them recede from you like mornings horizons like birds migrating to warmer climates their season having come to its quiet terminus ___ Never ending Story All descriptive world decoration my ambition to sire flames descendent not one word supercharged the desire of how stunning the revving an ambition to columns of water raised on revving engine of its the words drawn out to chaos its ambit precision its lists not one part missed in the full sweep that surveyed like a fuckin time traveler flying angle down toward a trillion waves all life since forever an epic movie spinning on a chip a bit of emitted light across my eye I am not alone in its witness but I feel its great solitude when I look I am slow to absorb it on purpose the hologram of its torch glows with each breath like a cigarette it's the best way sipping a spirit hot as red metal it goes a sword swallowers sword take the blade of the world in my stomach I found it buried sown like teeth in the ground sire of my lyrics And ever since I clung to it like a baby monkey ____ Blood A strain of waters mixed with sun lineage of silt death and hot lava in the bone descent of sap leaks down to us as we tongue out to the bulwark drink hot milk of god unto us lap dogs of infinity staring up at infinity dreaming of infinity dying of infinity __ History After rising from some obelisk slung with green after being ejected from a crowd enriched by noble aims after the grasses caught up in the motion of the wind awoke to me after stories were immortalised to blue dreams we washed away in her arms after which the weeping city enclosed all within its casement of intelligent metal and after knowing that this string of impossibilities was not meant for human reckoning after its disintegration unwound upon me like the way water works through stones as lucid as thought sluices and as icy And it's days just like this in which everything that you ever wanted disappears like vapour into the clouds Joining foreign tribes that roll across the stratosphere bursting over whole nations silent and heavy as the night they act in common wordlessly ___ Worth his union card of bees union of moths worth union of silent unfurling greenery in gods hothouse union of gorgeous eyes momentarily in the streets stepped off with rain between the mosses toes of aphids worth my fire lit in the silica of gods neon the Cadillac of knowing in the waiting room of robots worth in the factory antechamber where the malfunctioning parts are examined more closely before being rejected the silica of the false eye the tarnish fades from the stones the sun absorbs the tarnish we fall apart from without knowing which we yearn the malfunctioning part what none other in the paint job fading from old cars apopasis the sky stricken stars it is not the enveloping space between mute years it is not immovable flight path of airliners and rows of selfsame houses of the bloodletting endless is not the course uninterrupted bending mind and metal is not the force which cruelly shapes it is not cloud hid light shapeless form of light drops on silk web falling swift sleep childhood echoes in the drift narcotic it is not ___ I took as my goal magnanimity of the word got it lit swaying drunkenly incomprehensible by moonlight Then woke up the next day and went to work All around me delivery drivers Rivers of them The city a living ant hill Before long I'll be gliding across the sky on a motorbike nine rings on each hand unchained of love for you If I could utter but once the secrets which it (sky) slipped to me If but once the tree swaying like seaweed in a current and in its promise you were to remain and if on bright phrases you strode through them preponderant on strength all yours on floors you erected several layers above the rest Could I not recall that together we had stepped through it together we had made the decision Needing a way to feel the light the mind created eyes not until they touched did they understand each others darkness skies the mind discovered that present sorrow alone cannot dispel Silver words of water pouring down the gutters speaks of god like sisters gully cutting clear and sonnet to the ears I let it fall without restrain for coins of this mint like this drown on my head all day 
long years down my gullet No spitting image to refrain from the washing of flashing gutters and sparkling radio waves in my ears chittering illegibly it's guttural song while every syllable of moonlight stutters the road it's winding mutters and i think i understand va800 12224 with light addicted mind If Tomorrow It's a warm night winter is ending The atmosphere is giving up the past Things that have happened to me All of them even if not immediately I don't want to come across as though there's ways I want to come across There's nothing really to say But there are the rows of well cut hedges right there the year 2007 the lights through the high glass windows in the houses in the bougie suburbs Theres the vastness of the night over the mall car park and its tiny streetlights the year 2007 Drinking silver vodka straight out of the bottle Like a hot bullet it goes into the stomach No way home No money No way No now 2007 The year The pain of not of her And suddenly right now As winter ends The heat of spring on the wings The pain is transfigured forwards And now is then and maybe the pain I felt in 2007 is the pain of all time of now A night flower Balloon Why does it feel so good to give it up released it skyward like a kids balloon It floats up the god vault surrounded by air flanked and welcomed by tribes of which the clouds just continue on their way across the vast blue plains Why does nothing happen like the world is stuck underwater You can see their lips move but you cannot hear what they say Why does every movement escape you like running in a dream And why do these eyes gleam so like daggers flashing forest fires at night time There is no sound that feels at home in his mouth there is nothing welcomed in his gaze the cities continue to fall away from him like the stones of dead cathedrals taken over by heroin users mute dumb and eyes cancelled birds have gone there to die his soul is delicate as their disused tiny wings as diaphanous and select limp and forgotten by the sky who fathered them he gathers these sorrows like gems to see the sun through them he borrows facets and is lost Sky.exe sky.lib AI's trained on only images of the sky Libraries with billions of images of the sky only Some kind of executable that takes over and just shows you the sky The SKY itself You stare at But will never escape to As the yolk of clouds spills out in slow motion and gentle noise ambient of city makes me restive and the strain of life and work is removed until tomorrow the sky my mind ORDER on the bus thought fell On my on my head like a dead angel looking up between the skyscrapers their shadows crisscrossing air dust hanging in yellow shafts as if caught a symmetry of order emerging just in time And I have not forgotten it doesn't seem my fault thoughts just fall into place like tessellating light But I should be looking at the sky I don't even need my own self poetry isn't shit a path to neutral for idiots a way straight into the ground the terminus of thought an suited to being initiated by some series of completely innocuous encounters Even something I might do regularly without even thinking about it Or even something that everyone does habitually And when I try to reflect on how it might have begun I get that feeling you get when you purposefully try to remember something you've forgotten You never remember it you just circle around a void that gives you nothing the more you try to see into it It's like the bend in a train window which curves the lights inside the carriage and hides the silhouettes beyond Cocooned in your little tunnel of light you go around blind to the variations of the night outside Well you just sit there Really you just sit there with nothing to look at except your own face and the light bending around it that’s too bright You just sit there and the world moves around you even when you get on the train and walk home you don’t really move Like a point in great pre-established wave What then are we doing Nothing Our work is nothing And But Inmates Of Heaven The Narcotic Machine My consternation about getting shit I want goes right to the heart of something big It’s in the air And I have a strong suspicion that I have something that can shed some light on it Being against for example Kendrick Lamar a guy whose wealth is my not even a blip compared to those who are actually at the helm of Capitalism Why is the world full of sadness on the under side the waters face reflects unnoticed Bubble gum of phlegm coughed into my mouth from somewhere at the back of my throat After all was said and done I was just a kid who came to the big city and discovered he liked getting high more than anything else In mirror conversant I thought I could just wander into some blue collar state of grace But instead just upped my dosage of despair Suddenly in need of long books explaining why I feel an affinity for Molotov cocktails delinquency the mob Build the commonest Australian house type but 10ft underground like a tomb DISINTEGRATED Divide the creation of an artwork into discreet units and then perform just one of them over and over and over again. From Bankstown station I saw the morning sky in which a plane angled far away origin of nothing the silence of sound in halls of after noon light dread drowning for just one phrase to strike steel and coined for another that at work or in despair might reflect acknowledged I couldn't care less about a soul so much as this truth that is at all instants about to perish and which I share with all who live like me what will become of it if I don’t spit it out right now treat dreams as less real just this once ___ Your lack of convictions suggest in fact a secret hidden conviction toward something else ____ Blues They would not dream us instead their own blue distances dispersed by longing echoes reaching all the way to Canada at the best of times the marinaras trench at others haunting the pearl eyed in the trenches silent as martyrs as if inhabiting for billions of years the very soul of the planet ___ Metal Proof The voice as to the smoke it criss cross to the sky whispers and to the memories enfolded whispers to what waters that sluice inward to the earth evaporating like memories and lives and the whole past whispers all THE TERRORIST POTLATCH I want to write something I want this writing to be a rational exploration I want to uncover the algorithms of power and natural force But also the flip side the strange mute citadel glimmering at white noon Cars in schools flowing of automatic synchronicity as like great shoals glinting as each thousand turns as one through the blue The cost of perfection The loss of other ness In the face of nature The transcendence of technique At the same time taking notice of the unfolding of late sun rays across the skidding clouds amassed along the horizon like a great legion awaiting nightfall Not one essential gift of anonymous god gone yet Despite the plastic in the breast milk And becoming nucleus of the tiny icicles forming over mountains where rain awaits I want to give voice to my experience in the labour force of the heat beating down as sweat drips in my eyes and my grip on impact driver slips and the metal is ringing as it radiates Somehow I want these vectors open up a way to talk about ontology epistemology religion and science Somehow I want to also maintain my silence so as not to inadvertently condone or perpetuate the very thing I aim to bring down Chapter 5 Tawhid wa jihad To learn the value of something simply remove it To learn the value of work cease work To learn the value of thought cease to think and reflect acting only To learn the value of action and impulse try never to do anything or influence any outcome Through its disappearance and eclipse you will discover what it supplied what it meant what was its joy Though I never got sick of it when I had it daily the true value of repose wasn’t revealed to me until I was starved of it The value of work until my aversion to it created a sickness The value of thought until I had no time to reflect The value of a friend until I had lost all contact with society This pond is not the wild which is gone even the vast national parks are today just like this pond That is they are little miniatures little globes we look into to discover ourselves little fragments of real existence we use like witching rods virgules to find the water beneath the surface Since our soul has whispers barely snatched from the air as we in bewilderment to all the world and everything uncomprehendingly stare departing as slowly as an ember loses heat or sudden as a piston takes ignition unbending to fear for from no harm hate arises by our own blades we shape and are shaped thereby ___ Meds Non Dew Drops droplets piling up in his mouth the gold of twisted like lights distances to its threads sweet vintage you told of shapen to my tongue its cold shriven
